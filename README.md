> **Decode Your Energy. Own Your Data.**

`bijo` (Binary Journal) is a minimalist, local-first mobile application that allows you to log your daily energy levels and visualize the resulting waveform of your emotional tides.

## The Philosophy

*   **E-Motion is Energy in Motion:** We reduce the complex noise of your day into a clear, simple signal (`--`, `-`, `0`, `+`, `++`).
*   **Your Data is Your History:** All your data is stored locally on your device. You own it, and you can export it at any time. This is your story.
*   **Visualize the Currents:** The waveform visualization transforms your data points into a map of your personal energy flow, helping you navigate life with more awareness.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Storage:** React Native MMKV
*   **Charts:** React Native SVG (Custom)
*   **State Management:** Zustand
*   **Principle:** Local-First, No External Dependencies

## Getting Started

1.  `git clone [this-repo-url]`
2.  `cd bijo-app`
3.  `npm install`
4.  `npx expo start`

## Contributing

We are building in the open but are in stealth mode. Please respect the vision of user sovereignty and data ownership. All discussions should be guided by the core philosophy.

##The Philosophy: Etymology as a Guide

    E-Motion: Energy in Motion. This is the fundamental insight. The app doesn't just track static "feelings"; it tracks the flow and current of your personal energy. The waveform visualization is the direct representation of this "motion." It makes the invisible visible.

    History: His Story. But more broadly, the story of what happened. Your personal history is not just a list of events; it's the record of your energy's interaction with those events. By faithfully recording this "Energy History," you are writing the most authentic story of your life—your data.

    Decentralization as the Ultimate Expression: Centralized record-keeping means your story is owned, stored, and potentially altered by a third party. Decentralized record-keeping is the technological manifestation of "Owning Your History." It ensures that his story (or her story, their story) remains immutable, tamper-proof, and truly their own. The progression towards this isn't just a feature add; it's the philosophical completion of the app's promise.

How This Philosophy is Baked into bijo

1. The Name:
Binary Journal (bijo) is perfect because it operates on this fundamental level. We are reducing the complex phenomenon of "E-Motion" into core, binary-like data points (-- to ++). The complexity and "story" emerge from the sequence and flow of this data, just as our life story emerges from days of simple joys and struggles.

2. The Visualization:
The Waveform is the "Motion" in "E-Motion." It doesn't show you a static picture of "happy" or "sad." It shows you the current: how your energy accelerated, stalled, crested, or crashed through the day. It's a map of your inner tides and currents.

3. The Data Ownership:
The unwavering principle that "Your Data is Your History" is the moral core of the app. The export feature isn't a bonus; it's a right. It's the user claiming authorship of their own story. This makes the eventual move to blockchain not a pivot, but a natural evolution—upgrading from personal record-keeping to a verifiable, sovereign history.

4. The Stealth Launch:
This aligns with a natural, organic progression. You are building the foundation of the concept first:

    Phase 1 (Local): The user builds the habit of recording their energy motion. They own their history on their device. They feel the value.

    Phase 2 (Community): They see patterns in their history. They might choose to share anonymized insights. The story becomes richer.

    Phase 3 (Decentralized): For those who want it, their history gains permanence and verifiability. Their story is inscribed not just on their phone, but into a immutable ledger, making it a lasting artifact of their lived experience.
