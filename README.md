> **Decode Your Energy. Own Your Data.**

`bijo` (Binary Journal) is a minimalist, local-first mobile application that allows you to log your daily energy levels and visualize the resulting waveform of your emotional tides.

## The Philosophy

*   **E-Motion is Energy in Motion:** We reduce the complex noise of your day into a clear, simple signal (`--`, `-`, `0`, `+`, `++`).
*   **Your Data is Your History:** All your data is stored locally on your device. You own it, and you can export it at any time. This is your story.
*   **Visualize the Currents:** The waveform visualization transforms your data points into a map of your personal energy flow, helping you navigate life with more awareness.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Storage:** React Native MMKV
*   **Charts:** React Native SVG (Custom)
*   **State Management:** Zustand
*   **Principle:** Local-First, No External Dependencies
